I visited Spalding Park for a basketball session with Alex, Ritvik, and Shantiv. We decided to test a new park instead of outdoor courts at the ARC.

Spalding Park was adjacent to a sports complex and school. It had plentiful parking and was quite lively. There was a baseball practice going on, a basketball game, and some people at the skate park.

The skate park was a very unique feature of the park.

The tennis courts were very busy the entire time I was there.

The basketball court was acceptable. We played `AP + RA` vs `SS + AG`, `AP + RA` taking a best of three series `2-1`.

Overall, Spalding Park was nice. Next time, I'll stop by King Park and Hazel Park on the way. I noticed Hazel Park does have basketball hoops as well, so we might play there next.
