I got lunch, some ice cream from nearby Jarlings, and then sat down to work at Hessel Park. This park was very active, even at 2 PM on a Tuesday. The parks proximity to Champaign is a strong plus.

I sat down at a shaded picnic table to work. Many people were walking around, playing at the playground, or playing pickleball.

Hessel Park was pretty big for spending one day. There were some very pretty flower beds lining the welcome signs. Overall, it was a very pretty and well maintained park with many visitors.
