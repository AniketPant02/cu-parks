I visited the Chief Shemauger Park in Urbana, IL on the 7th of October. The park is named after a "Patowatomi Chief who signed a treaty with white settlers who moved to Urbana" [[source]](https://www.urbanaparks.org/location/chief-shemauger-park). Some more historical information is [provided here](https://www.urbanaparks.org/news/learn-more-about-chief-shemauger), like how Chief Shemauger advocated for peace with white settlers, helped bury their dead, and was in turn ordered by the Federal government to relocate to a reservation in Kansas.

The park is nice enough, though, it has a weird layout. It's next to a cemetery, so it's hard to tell what the bounds of the park are before you are being intrusive.

There is enough room to throw a frisbee, there is a baseball diamond, basketball hoops, and a few picnic tables.

Overall, it was nice.

I am hoping these large, bright moons will not decimate my upcoming Milky Way shot - I am renting a UIUC camera tomorrow (Tuesday) to try shooting.

The park was pretty average and had the essentials. It was fine. I probably wont return, since I'm on a time crunch to visit all of the other parks + hit 50 posts.
