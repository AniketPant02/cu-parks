I visited Centennial Park on Sept. 24th. September is almost over but I still have 33 parks to visit to hit my goal of 50. 

I will probably have to start visiting multiple in one go.

Centennial Park is a large park, on ~70 acres. It includes the Children's Farm, with some animals and a petting zoo sort of attraction.

This seems like some disc game - only park I've seen this setup at in Champaign so far.

The park also had the steepest hill I have seen in Champaign-Urbana so far. It would be perfect for sledding. So far this is my top sledding pick.

The park also features large amounts of open grassy area for frisbee/soccer/others. The soccer goals are well maintained.

I made some new friends at the park.

The park also features the Sholem Aquatic Center, but it didn't seem to be in use.

The Fall colors arrived and left for this tree.

Overall, Centennial Park was good. It's also very close to Peter's house (~2 minute drive). I will probably visit again.
