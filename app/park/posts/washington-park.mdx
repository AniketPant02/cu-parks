I walked past Washington Park, currently under construction and closed off, during a nighttime campus walk with my friend.

The park, apparently also known as "Frat Park", was very nicely lit. On one side of the road, there were basketball hoops setup, and on the other side, a wide open grass lot.

Park was fine, maybe slightly below average. Plus, it felt like it was in a busy part of town, even in the night (~11 PM). I probably won't return, but the nighttime walk all around campus was very nice. As always, I was impressed to see how busy Red Lion/Green St. was on a Monday. I was also happy I got to visit 2 parks on my list today.
