I visited South Ridge Park on Sept. 17th. It's only slightly further from me than Meadowbrook Park. It's located in a large neighborhood.

Most of the park is just a large roundabout walking path centered around this meadow area.

One of my favorite perks of Urbana-Champaign is that when you reach the edge of the city, you have miles and miles of farmland and unobstructed views. 

This park shares one side with farmland.

There were many Monarch butterflies along the walkway.

The walk around South Ridge Park was nice. Parking is very limited though I doubt the park gets too busy.
