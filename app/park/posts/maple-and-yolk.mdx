In September, I took Bill to Merry Ann's, where we shared a brunch. After that, in early October, Bill and I went to Maple and Yolk, where we left empty handed after facing a 1.5 hour wait for walk-ins. We relocated to "Le Peep".

Finally, on October 19th, I was very happy to be able to attend brunch with all my friends at Maple and Yolk. I was surprised to see all of them not only get out of bed before 11 AM, but also be *on time*.

I had a delicious skillet hash. 

When I was shortly in Los Angeles (for a ~week), I frequently visited a restaurants called "Black Cow" with a very tasty, weekend-only special of Corned Beef Hash. That is now my gold standard for skillet dishes and other corned beef hash.
