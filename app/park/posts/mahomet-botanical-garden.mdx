I visited the Mabery Gelvin Botanical Garden in Mahomet, IL on Oct 3rd, 2025. There is a nice plaque in the gardens in which Mr. Gelvin dedicates the botanical garden to Mrs. Gelvin. The gardens, right next to the Lake of the Woods park, were about a 27 minute drive from my apartment in Urbana, IL.

It's a small but very well maintained Botanical Garden. Walking around was very relaxing and a good way to pass ~1 hour.

I captured some pictures of some garden buddies.

It was very well decorated with some Fall decorations recently placed. The gardens were relatively empty without too many people.

I got to sit around this and relax. The weather was very nice, with a small breeze. The water had many lily pads.

The water was also full of MANY koi fish. It was a surprise to see this in IL. The biggest fish seemed to be fighting the smaller ones.

After thoroughly enjoying the Botanical Gardens, I walked over to the "Museum of the Grand Prairie". I was surprised to find a nuanced collection of historical elements related to various history around IL and the prairie. There was a large focus on elements related to Abraham Lincoln, with many stories of his time in the IL/Urbana/surrounding area.

On the way home, I did stop by and scout the "Alto Vineyards", which seems like could be a good time with friends, slightly outside the city. I met a lady there who coincidentally was in charge of classroom/building renovations in MSEB, and talked to her about her work at the U of I for a while.

Overall, both the gardens and the museum were enjoyable. This will probably conclude my visits to Mahomet, IL.
