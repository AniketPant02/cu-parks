On the 20th of November, I attended another performance of the UISO. Looking forward to Yuyuan's solo, the program for tonight...
1. AARON COPLAND's *Suite from Billy the Kid*
2. INGRID STÖLZEL's *Comet Coggia*
3. MAURICE RAVEL's *Suite No. 2 from Daphnis et Chloé*

The show was fantastic - the best of FA2025. *Daphnis et Chloé*, the most well known, was good, but my favorite was the *Comet Coggia*, of which this session was the premiere. Link here: [Ingrid Stölzel](https://ingridstolzel.com/event/premiere-performance-of-comet-coggia-for-orchestra).

There was a livestream. I mischeviously went to the front of the Hall, so I could wave hi to some spectators.

Outside of Krannert, a foggy Urbana-Champaign was waiting for me.

One of my favorite subreddits is ["r/TheNightFeeling"](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNightFeeling/). The photo was inspired by wanting to evoke a similar feeling.

Overall, all of campus was *extremely* hazy/foggy. To the point where driving was borderline dangerous. It was an extremely cool experience.

Krannert concerts were a great experience. We get to support students (e.g. the musicians and team staffing Krannert), enjoy some great performances (e.g. I attended Orfeo last year, which was great), and the tickets are **cheap** (only $4 for students). In a short time at UIUC, I have extracted much value from Krannert.
