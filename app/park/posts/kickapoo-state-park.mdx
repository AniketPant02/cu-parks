I opted to go to Kickapoo State Park on a random Wednesday - I'd been meaning to go for some time.

I toured the area by car mostly. There were some very nice and well maintained lookout spots. Many nice ponds and lakes to explore.

I sat next to this lake to eat my lunch. I think I might've been the only human at the park. I don't think I saw a single other car or person. Very peaceful.

Afterwards, I found some playground/picnic area and worked on my laptop. I watched some lecture videos for my Asian Mythology class. I didn't capture a picture of my work area. Working here for an hour or two concluded my trip to the Kickapoo. I'll be back with some friends to do the "Kickapoo Adventures" stuffs, like some boating, etc.
