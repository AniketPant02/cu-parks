Meadowbrook is a well know, large park in Urbana-Champaign. I have spent many hours here, working, gardening, and walking. I play frisbee here and have shot many astro-pictures here.

I like the large field for frisbee on the park side.

The walking loop is nice and easy, though multiple times I've encountered deer.

The garden side is also nice. The meditation area is peaceful and well-maintained, with a small bridge that carries you into the large prairie.

Some pictures below.

There are two sides of Meadowbrook: the park and the gardens. The walking loop forms a circle between these two points. There are large fields on both sides. Lastly, the prairie observation deck is a nice feature of the park.

The meadow looks very nice in the Spring/Fall. There is a risk of ticks and I have encountered many.
