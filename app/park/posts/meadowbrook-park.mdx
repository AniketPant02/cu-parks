Meadowbrook is a well know, large park in Urbana-Champaign. 

I like the large field for frisbee on the park side.

The walking loop is nice and easy, though multiple times I've encountered deer.

The garden side is also nice. The meditation area is peaceful and well-maintained, with a small bridge that carries you into the large prairie.



There is a risk of ticks and I have encountered many.
