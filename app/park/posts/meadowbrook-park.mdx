Meadowbrook is a well know, large park in Urbana-Champaign. I have spent many hours here, working, gardening, and walking. I play frisbee here and have shot many astro-pictures here.

I like the large field for frisbee on the park side.

The walking loop is nice and easy, though multiple times I've encountered deer.

The garden side is also nice. The meditation area is peaceful and well-maintained, with a small bridge that carries you into the large prairie.

For some time, I worked (and then managed) the Meadowbrook Learning Garden. This was one of my most impactful learning experiences/memories at UIUC (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025).

Some pictures below.

There are two sides of Meadowbrook: the park and the gardens. The walking loop forms a circle between these two points. There are large fields on both sides. Lastly, the prairie observation deck is a nice feature of the park.

The meadow looks very nice in the Spring/Fall. There is a risk of ticks and I have encountered many.

We (Urbana-Champaign) are truly lucky to have Meadowbrook.

**09/12/2025 update: Meadowbrook Jazz Walk**

I attended the Meadowbrook Jazz Walk. It was wonderful. Very, very busy - the busiest I have seen Meadowbrook Park. It felt like the whole town had come out, minus the UIUC students.

There was a lot of Jazz music to enjoy. In a circle around the park (more on the garden/meadow side), there were various stops along the walking path.

I was joined by Alex. It was a fun evening activity.
