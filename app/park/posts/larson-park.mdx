Larson Park was a short drive from South Ridge Park, so I visited it right after. With 30-ish parks left to visit, I have to be intentional about visiting nearby parks. To make that easier, I added a new "map" feature to my app (on the **lists** page) which shows a user their location and nearby geolocated parks.

Similar to South Ridge, Larson Park was in the middle of a neighborhood.

The entrance to Larson Park was cool.

There was a decent amount of usable area. There was a painted (kind of poorly maintained) soccer field. Also, a very short walkway.

Lots of squirrels running around.

The tennis courts seemed pristine, and they also had pickleball court markings. A little hard to see in the picture.

To the right of this, there were also some picnic tables shaded by trees to sit at.

Overall, the park was simple and nice.
