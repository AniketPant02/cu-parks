I visited the 144 acre Crystal Lake Park, located centrally near the Carle complex on Sept. 18th. Prior, I got coffee with Bill for his first time at Caffe Paradiso. He hated the coffee, and I myself think their offerings suck - I am afraid Caffe Paradiso has been blacklisted, even [though Obama visited](https://www.news-gazette.com/news/surprise-visit-has-patrons-at-urbanas-caffe-paradiso-in-well-paradise/article_d4c4a0e5-6fab-555d-9cfe-8eedfd502dbf.html).

Crystal Lake Park shares a border with Carle, a neighborhood, the Champaign County Fairgrounds, and Busey Woods.  I entered from the Carle side and went to the central lake area. The whole park was very busy today. There were people fishing, grilling, playing, a few people on picnics, and more.

The lake area was nice, with many connecting bridges and a small "lake house" for renting. It connects to the other portions of the park, like this hill I found that I am sure would be fun during winter for sledding.

I walked around the whole park area, along the County Fairgrounds.

Below is a view from the North Pavilion, with lots of trees and usable green area for activities. There were one or two picnic-ers.

I met a new friend while walking near the water. A nearby sign told me I spotted a *"great blue heron".*

After Crystal Lake and a quick detour to Schnucks, I cooked some **VERY good fried rice**. My best yet.

The plating could be better. It was so good I delivered some to Peter.

Overall, Crystal Lake was great. There was some playground area I didn't get to explore today, so I might go back to do that at some point.
