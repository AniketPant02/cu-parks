I visited Heritage Park while I was doing some chore in the nearby area.

I passed some time sitting at a picnic bench here, eating lunch. I was joined by some geese. There were a few shaded picnic tables to choose from.

The park is right across the street from the "soccer field" side of Dodd's Park (near Parkland College). I'll make a post on Dodd's soon.

I was surprised with how big Heritage Park was, considering Dodd's Park was right nextdoor. The park looks deceptively small from the road, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much green space there was.

You can see a nice, long walkway that surrounds the waterbody in the middle. It would make for a great frisbee session.

One day I'll return to complete the whole walkway around the lake/pond in the middle.

Overall, this park was very nice. Tomorrow, I'll likely visit Allerton Park after a visit to the Monticello Rail Museum, so an upcoming post on that.
