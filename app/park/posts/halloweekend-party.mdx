On October 25th, I attended a Halloween/Birthday party in Urbana, IL.

I got to meet many Indian friends, mostly from the Gies side, such as Adarsh, Praytush, Sid, and a few more.

I took Alex and Ritvik with me. Alex was the ONLY one dressed in a Halloween costume, as pictured above.

Alex and Ritvik had, clearly, a lot of fun.

I must have had some fun too.

Overall, a good night with good friends.
