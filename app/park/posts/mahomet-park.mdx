This is a massive nature/forest preserve in Mahomet, IL. It features some very nice parks, but also a Botanical Gardens, camping grounds, and more. The city itself is quite quaint. I also visited Barber Park while in Mahomet, but it wasn't noteworthy.

This was approximately a 20-25 minute drive from my place in Urbana, IL. The area was quite busy.

There are many waterbodies to explore as well. Here is a picture of one, from near a picnic/camping area.

Lastly, there was a fun bridge to drive your car through. It was cute and surprising.

Overall, Lake of the Woods was fun. Mahomet, IL itself gave me some weird vibes. But Lake of the Woods was good. I'll probably come again.
