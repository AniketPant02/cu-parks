I've spent a lot of time at this park playing basketball. They have a satisfactory basketball court setup - not the best but it gets the job done when ARC is busy.

The park is pretty simple. It has a huge open grass area. The park features basketball, a soccer goal, playgrounds, and tennis courts.

Normally, when I've visited this park multiple times I did not spend much time exploring, just enjoyed the basketball court.

However since starting this blog I explored the park some more towards the backside. The walking trail is quite extensive and goes through a decently maintained prairie land, with a short boardwalk. I didn't expect such a setup from a relatively small park.

There is a hill visible in the above image; it might be good for sledding in the winter.

Overall, Sunset Ridge Park is great.
