I briefly visited the Champaign Bark District (funny name vs. Champaign Park District) on my way out of the Porter Family Park.

I think the Champaign Bark District requires purchasing a membership? Anyways, I only briefly visited.

As expected, the Champaign Bark District was very busy with many dogs.

If I was a dog, I would surely love this park.
