I visited Allerton Park with Bill on the 9th of November. It was a quick 30 minute drive from my home. 

Normally, I get approx. 7-9 mpg in my car on daily drives, so longer drives on the freeway are fun. That's because the gas estimation says `$X` miles remaining, but often, driving on the freeway at ~20+ mpg gives me "free miles" when the range gets recalculated. So, I started the drive to Allerton with ~180 miles, and finished with ~194 miles. 🤪

Allerton Park was a fine nearby attraction. Bill and I walked some, hiked some. Took a few pictures.

We did a circular tour of the grounds, starting with the "Vine Walk" and the "House of the Golden Buddhas".

Fall has definitely setttled in. The House of the Golden Buddhas has a weary looking spiral staircase for an elevated view of both the Vine Walk and the gallery of Chinese "Fu Dog" statues.

Here is a picture of one of the statues presented. Bill told me a little bit about them. Some Googling tells me...
1. The Fu Dog style is also known as Chinese Guardian Lions (referred to as "Shi" = lions).
2. Stone lions are "shishi", bronze lions are "tongshi".
3. History of the guardian lions dates back thousands of years to the Han Dynasty (221 BCE - 200 CE), later being co-opted by Buddhist iconography.
4. They became introduced to the west on ships via merchants, mercernaries, etc. (~16th century).

The scenery at Allerton was great. The walkable greens were relatively small/"succint". It was a nice walk.

Bill had a small adventure.

On the way to Allerton, I took a very quick detour when passing Monticello to show Bill the train museum I showed Alex. Then, on the very next day, I attended an art show at the Savoy Recreation Center, where I spotted some art from Monticello and Allerton. With permission, I snapped some photos.

Since the art show featured mostly local artists, much of the visual art was from nearby areas. It was really fun seeing art from areas I had explored. I went around asking the artists if they could point out nearby spots in their art. I saw some photography from Starved Rock, Allerton Park, Homer Lake, and other nearby areas.

Overall, Allerton Park with Bill was fine. I don't think I'll go again.
