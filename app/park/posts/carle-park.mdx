Carle Park was quite nice. It is very nicely shaded with many tall trees.

There is one nice soccer goal which could be good for practicing but not for a full game. The park itself is a nice walk with many nice benches to break at.

The central fixture (dedicated to Abraham Lincoln IIRC) is well maintained.
