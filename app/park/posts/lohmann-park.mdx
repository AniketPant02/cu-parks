September 10th, I visited Lohmann Park. Not the best day. I returned from some travel back home to Birmingham, AL and have fallen behind on my park-visiting schedule.

I tried to work but mostly just sat in the park and listened to some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1V6cQJpbc4&list=RDYr4tx6wPVhw&index=8).

The park is nice and expansive. It is conjoined with a small neigborhood with some very active development and only a short drive from the Urbana side of campus.

Here's a view from the picnic table I sat at. In the picture in a tree far away, you can see some Fall colors begin to emerge.

The park features opportunities for enjoying disc golf. There are disc golf holes all over the park. One day, perhaps I will return to play disc golf with my friends. But first, I need friends who will play disc golf.

Overall, the park is nice.
