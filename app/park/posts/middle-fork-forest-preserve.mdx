On October 28th, I attended a concert of the Illinois Wind Symphony. Prior to this, I had attending another concert of the University of Illinois Symphony Orchestra (UISO), where I got to see Yuyuan (after many months) play ([UISO listing](https://krannertcenter.com/events/university-illinois-symphony-orchestra-meredith-chamber-singers-and-oratorio-society-durufl%C3%A9s)).

After walking home, I enjoyed a walk around the Urbana "circle lamp district". I'm a big fan of the circular lamps all over town (e.g., the ones spread around Carle Park).
