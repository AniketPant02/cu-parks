On October 28th, I attended a concert of the Illinois Wind Symphony. Prior to this, I had attending another concert of the University of Illinois Symphony Orchestra (UISO), where I got to see Yuyuan (after many months) play ([UISO listing](https://krannertcenter.com/events/university-illinois-symphony-orchestra-meredith-chamber-singers-and-oratorio-society-durufl%C3%A9s)).

In both concerts, I, by coincidence, met Jack. Jack is a PhD student in the Braun group.

The music was very nice. The music played by the Wind Symphony was much more "alive". The UISO felt like some spooky/Halloween theme.

The Wind Symphony program is here:
```
Gao Hong: Celebration
Joaquin Turina, arr. John Krance and Kevin Geraldi: Eight Miniatures, Op. 52
Vincent Persichetti: Masquerade
Jules Strens: Danse Funambulesque
```

Leaving Krannert, I had a wonderful night waiting for me. Some rain that was both very light and prominent to keep me thinking, a wonderful smell, and some clouds running around. 

After walking home, I enjoyed a walk around the Urbana "circle lamp district". I'm a big fan of the circular lamps all over town (e.g., the ones spread around Carle Park).
