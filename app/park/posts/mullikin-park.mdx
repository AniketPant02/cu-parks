Mullikin Park was my last stop on Oct 1st's 3 peat. It's a small park inside a neighborhood, approximately 2 minutes away from Porter Family Park.

It's a small park, relatively. It has a playground, some green space with a large soccer goal, a small paved area for basketball, and a covered picnic table setup.

I stopped by to play some basketball. It worked fine for shooting by myself but I wouldn't play here with my friends.

Some kids got excited about the car so I let them get inside while I was shooting basketball. One kid seemed particularly passionate about cars.

Sharing the car with interested youth is always fun. Overall it was funny. The kids seemed young but had much, much worse vocabulary than I did at the same age. I was impressed by some of the things they said.

Overall, shooting hoops at Mullikin Park was fun.
