I visited Witt Park in Sidney, IL on a Friday afternoon.

Witt Park has 2 large baseball diamonds, a small playground area and some open field.

I've visited Sidney and Witt Park many times. The drive there is always fun and only approx. 20-25 mins.

I visited what is likely my favorite house in CU/Sidney/Philo/nearby area: the "house with the pond".

I parked on some country road to watch the harvester working. I walked over to a nearby tractor and got to take a look inside. This was a fun spontaneous side quest in Sidney.

Finally, I visited the Sidney Dairy Barn. Likely, this will be my last visit. 

This place is special to me as this is one of the very first places I stumbled upon after arriving in Urbana-Champaign. The first time I arrived, the place was completely packed, so an old couple invited me to sit with them. For them, it was a 50th anniversary over ice cream. They pointed me to Meadowbrook Park, where I found the Meadowbrook Gardens :)

Witt Park and the small town of Sidney was great.
