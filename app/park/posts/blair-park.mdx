I visited Blair Park in Urbana, IL. It's very close to Carle Park. It was quite busy. Blair Park's online website suggests its the only park in the district with **lit** tennis courts.

Next to the picnic area, there were some nice trees casting some shade in which some kids were playing.

There were quite a few activities to do at Blair Park, such as tennis, basketball (there was a court), frisbee, picnics, baseball, a small workout area (like the outdoor one near ARC), and more.

Blair Park gave me a small take-home gift. Oops.

Overall, Blair Park was great and very excitingly busy at around 4:30 PM. I would visit again with friends.

Prior to visiting Blair Park, I visited a nearby hobby shop with my friends for an archery session. I was impressed with the store. The model planes were especially cool, along with the selection of vintage/classic car models.

The store had some vintage currency too, including a few examples of some 10 Yuan notes featuring Sun Yat-sen, likely from the Republic of China period.
