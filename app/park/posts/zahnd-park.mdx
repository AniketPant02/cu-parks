I visited Zahnd Park with my laptop to learn some Kubernetes (my goal was to deploy Postgres via K8s) after a Materials Colloquium.

I am slowly learning how to deploy each of the parts of my geoviz-streaming project to Kubernetes. I don't need Kubernetes, but this project has enough components/services to where it felt like a useful exercise to learn it.

Zahnd Park was okay. There was a nice football field with some game/practice going on so it was quite busy in the park. The park is near many apartments and a YMCA.

Zahnd Park is the 14th biggest park on my list at 20.6 acres, however, I was a little underwhelmed in comparison to some of the other parks I have explored. Since there's so many courts/football field/YMCA land in the park, the "green space" feels less.

But regardless, the park is large, well maintained, and busy. Parking was easy and the park was at the edge of city, with miles of farmland following it. It was decently far from UIUC, approx. 20 minute drive into the Champaign suburbs.

Overall, decent park.
